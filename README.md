EYE - Preserve memories. Have intelligent conversations.

We will keep tranning custom models as the main USP for the system.

The current system is ready for API integration and deployment.


The goal is to build a simple yet efficient system, keeping in mind that not everyone has access to high compute.
The system will have three configurations:

Heavy Load Mode – for advanced users with high compute.

Light Mode – optimized for basic inference and processing, similar to Google Photos or Apple Photos, so that even users with the slowest laptops can run it.

God Mode – the full, super-intelligent version with everything unlocked. Best Visual UI for the system.

I’ll focus on integrating visualization and gamification libraries — I already have ideas ready for that.
All the best to everyone working on this.

The current repository is far from usable, but with 4–8 week of work, it should reach a good state.
